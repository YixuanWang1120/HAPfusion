### HAPFusion: a heterogeneity-adaptive fusion model predicts immunotherapy response using clonal genomic features in group-structured datas

## Introduction
An innovative approach that integrates clonality mutational profiles from immunotherapy cohort-structured patients. Under the Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) framework, HAPFusion navigates multiple clinical endpoints and uncovers potential associations through random effects. Penalty terms can effectively address multicollinearity within clonal features, facilitating the identification of pivotal variables that enhance efficacy. We augment the model's interpretability and predictive accuracy and accommodate small sample sizes by considering coefficient differences across subgroups, thus promoting data sharing and adaptability across varied cohorts.
